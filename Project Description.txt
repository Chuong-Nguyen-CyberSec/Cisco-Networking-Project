Small Business with Branch Network Design

Overview
This project showcases the design and implementation of a network infrastructure for a small company with a branch office. The network leverages a hybrid architecture combining spine-leaf and two-tier designs to ensure optimal performance, scalability, and redundancy.

-------------Network Segmentation-------------

----HQ VLAN Structure---------
VLAN 10: Management and Server: Used for managing network devices, servers, and ensuring secure administrative access.
VLAN 20: Operation: Dedicated to the operations department for efficient data flow and access control.
VLAN 40: Finance: Isolated for the finance department to secure sensitive financial data.
VLAN 60: Access Points: Reserved for wireless access points to manage and segregate wireless traffic.

----Branch VLAN Structure------
VLAN 15: Branch Management: Dedicated to administrative and management tasks at the branch.
VLAN 30: Branch Operation: Allocated for the operations team at the branch office.
VLAN 50: Branch Services: Reserved for various service-oriented tasks and applications.

----Security Features-----------
-Switch and Router Hardening: Implemented robust password encryption and security policies on all routers and switches to protect against unauthorized access.

-VLAN Segmentation: Ensures isolation of department traffic, enhancing security and reducing broadcast traffic.

-Wireless Security: Utilizes WPA2-PSK for the wireless network on AccessPoint1, providing strong encryption for wireless communications.

-Port Security: Configured on HQ_Switch_1, HQ_Switch_2, HQ_Switch_3, and HQ_Switch_4 to limit the number of allowed MAC addresses per port, protecting against MAC flooding attacks.

-DHCP Snooping: Enabled on HQ_Switch_1, HQ_Switch_2, HQ_Switch_3, and HQ_Switch_4 to prevent rogue DHCP servers from distributing unauthorized IP addresses.

-Access Control Lists (ACLs):
Allows only SSH access to all network devices, securing remote management.
Blocks SSH and Telnet access from external networks on HQ_Wan_1 to protect against unauthorized access.

-IPSec VPN Tunnel: Encrypts data traffic between the HQ and branch office routers (HQ_Wan_1 and Branch_Router_1), ensuring secure and private communication. To verify encryption, use the command show crypto ipsec sa on ISP routers within the VPN tunnel.

-----------Redundancy Features------------
-HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol): Deployed on HQ_Spine_1, HQ_Spine_2, and HQ_Spine_3 for high availability, with HQ_Spine_1 as the active router and HQ_Spine_2 and HQ_Spine_3 as standby routers.

-Backup ISP Router: Provides an additional layer of redundancy for internet connectivity through ISP Router 2, ensuring continuous network availability.


------------Management------------------
-Network Controller: Each site is equipped with a network controller within the IT department's VLAN, facilitating comprehensive network management and health monitoring.
HQ Network Controller: Located on VLAN 10, IP 192.168.1.76
Branch Network Controller: Located on VLAN 15, IP 192.168.2.70

-Email Server: Located at the HQ, the email server supports company-wide email services. Administrators can efficiently manage user accounts, adding new employees and removing accounts for offboarding. Users can create email accounts on the server in VLAN 10, and there are several accounts already created for testing email functionality.

-OSPF Configuration: Implemented on HQ_Spine_1, HQ_Spine_2, HQ_Spine_3, HQ_Wan_1, and HQ_Wan_2 for dynamic and efficient routing, ensuring optimal path selection and network resilience. You can ping across both networks, and it typically takes 3-4 trials for OSPF and HSRP to fully load and stabilize.

-SSH Access: Secure SSH access is only permitted from PCs in VLAN 10 (HQ) and VLAN 15 (Branch).


---------Future Expansion---------
The network design supports easy, fast, and seamless expansion without disrupting ongoing operations. Key features include:

-DHCP Auto-Configuration: Automatically assigns IP addresses to new devices.
-OSPF (Open Shortest Path First): Ensures dynamic and efficient routing, adjusting automatically to changes in the network.
-HSRP: Maintains redundancy and high availability during expansion activities.

This design allows for straightforward scaling to accommodate future growth, ensuring the network remains robust and reliable.
